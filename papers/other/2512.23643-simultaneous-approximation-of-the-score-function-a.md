## Abstract

We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting.
