## Abstract

Diagrams are crucial for communicating complex information, yet creating and modifying them remains a labor-intensive task. We present GenAI-DrawIO-Creator, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate diagram generation and manipulation in the structured XML format used by draw.io. Our system integrates Claude 3.7 to reason about structured visual data and produce valid diagram representations. Key contributions include a high-level system design enabling real-time diagram updates, specialized prompt engineering and error-checking to ensure well-formed XML outputs. We demonstrate a working prototype capable of generating accurate diagrams (such as network architectures and flowcharts) from natural language or code, and even replicating diagrams from images. Simulated evaluations show that our approach significantly reduces diagram creation time and produces outputs with high structural fidelity. Our results highlight the promise of Claude 3.7 in handling structured visual reasoning tasks and lay the groundwork for future research in AI-assisted diagramming applications.
