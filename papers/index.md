### [SMART SLM: Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer, A Small Language Model for Accurate Document Assistance](/cs/ai/2512.21280-smart-slm-structured-memory-and-reasoning-transfo.md)
**Divij Dudeja, Mayukha Pal** · arXiv:2512.21280 · 2025-12-24 · `cs-ai`

The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material ...

### [Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty](/cs/ai/2512.21336-optimizing-decoding-paths-in-masked-diffusion-mode.md)
**Ziyu Chen, Xinbei Jiang, Peng Sun et al.** · arXiv:2512.21336 · 2025-12-24 · `cs-ai`

Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive ...

### [Parallel Token Prediction for Language Models](/cs/ai/2512.21323-parallel-token-prediction-for-language-models.md)

### [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](/cs/lg/2512.21315-does-the-data-processing-inequality-reflect-practi.md)
**Roy Turgeman, Tom Tirer** · arXiv:2512.21315 · 2025-12-24 · `cs-lg`

The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification prob...

### [TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning](/cs/cv/2512.21331-ticon-a-slide-level-tile-contextualizer-for-histo.md)

### [GriDiT: Factorized Grid-Based Diffusion for Efficient Long Image Sequence Generation](/cs/cv/2512.21276-gridit-factorized-grid-based-diffusion-for-effici.md)
**Snehal Singh Tomar, Alexandros Graikos, Arjun Krishna et al.** · arXiv:2512.21276 · 2025-12-24 · `cs-cv`

Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames.
