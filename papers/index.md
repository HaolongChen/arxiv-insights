### [BandiK: Efficient Multi-Task Decomposition Using a Multi-Bandit Framework](/cs/lg/2512.24708-bandik-efficient-multi-task-decomposition-using-a.md)
**András Millinghoffer, András Formanek, András Antos et al.** · arXiv:2512.24708 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-lg`

The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models.

### [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](/cs/lg/2512.25063-many-minds-from-one-model-bayesian-transformers-f.md)
**Diji Yang, Yi Zhang** · arXiv:2512.25063 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-lg`

Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we prop...

### [Efficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning](/cs/lg/2512.24991-efficiently-estimating-data-efficiency-for-languag.md)

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is...

### [Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future](/cs/lg/2512.25070-scaling-open-ended-reasoning-to-predict-the-future.md)

### [From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing](/cs/cv/2512.25066-from-inpainting-to-editing-a-self-bootstrapping-f.md)
**Xu He, Haoxian Zhang, Hejia Chen et al.** · arXiv:2512.25066 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-cv`

Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this wit...

### [Evolving, Not Training: Zero-Shot Reasoning Segmentation via Evolutionary Prompting](/cs/cv/2512.24702-evolving-not-training-zero-shot-reasoning-segmen.md)
**Kai Ye, Xiaotong You, Jianghang Lin et al.** · arXiv:2512.24702 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-cv`

Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain...
