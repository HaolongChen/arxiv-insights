The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification prob...

### [TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning](/cs/cv/2512.21331-ticon-a-slide-level-tile-contextualizer-for-histo.md)
