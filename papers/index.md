Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometr...

### [VIVA: VLM-Guided Instruction-Based Video Editing with Reward Optimization](/cs/cv/2512.16906-viva-vlm-guided-instruction-based-video-editing-w.md)

### [Differences That Matter: Auditing Models for Capability Gap Discovery and Rectification](/cs/cv/2512.16921-differences-that-matter-auditing-models-for-capab.md)
**Qihao Liu, Chengzhi Mao, Yaojie Liu et al.** · arXiv:2512.16921 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-cv`

Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing...

### [MomaGraph: State-Aware Unified Scene Graphs with Vision-Language Model for Embodied Task Planning](/cs/cv/2512.16909-momagraph-state-aware-unified-scene-graphs-with-v.md)
**Yuanchen Ju, Yongyuan Liang, Yen-Jen Wang et al.** · arXiv:2512.16909 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-cv`

Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate.

Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and funct...

### [Next-Embedding Prediction Makes Strong Vision Learners](/cs/cv/2512.16922-next-embedding-prediction-makes-strong-vision-lear.md)
**Sihan Xu, Ziqiao Ma, Wenhao Chai et al.** · arXiv:2512.16922 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-cv`

Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. Thi...

### [Make-It-Poseable: Feed-forward Latent Posing Model for 3D Humanoid Character Animation](/cs/cv/2512.16767-make-it-poseable-feed-forward-latent-posing-model.md)

### [Learning Model Parameter Dynamics in a Combination Therapy for Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data](/cs/lg/2512.15706-learning-model-parameter-dynamics-in-a-combination.md)
**Kayode Olumoyin, Lamees El Naqa, Katarzyna Rejniak** · arXiv:2512.15706 · 2025-12-17 · `cs-lg`

In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often ...

### [Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars: A Hybrid Representation for Efficient Rendering](/cs/cv/2512.15711-gaussian-pixel-codec-avatars-a-hybrid-representat.md)
**Divam Gupta, Anuj Pahuja, Nemanja Bartolovic et al.** · arXiv:2512.15711 · 2025-12-17 · `cs-cv`
