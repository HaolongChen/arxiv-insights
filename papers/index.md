While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos....

### [Making Large Language Models Efficient Dense Retrievers](/other/2512.20612-making-large-language-models-efficient-dense-retri.md)
**Yibin Lei, Shwai He, Ang Li et al.** · arXiv:2512.20612 · 2025-12-23 · `other`

Recent work has shown that directly fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for dense retrieval yields strong performance, but their substantial parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it re...

### [Scalably Enhancing the Clinical Validity of a Task Benchmark with Physician Oversight](/cs/ai/2512.19691-scalably-enhancing-the-clinical-validity-of-a-task.md)

### [GenEnv: Difficulty-Aligned Co-Evolution Between LLM Agents and Environment Simulators](/cs/ai/2512.19682-genenv-difficulty-aligned-co-evolution-between-ll.md)
**Jiacheng Guo, Ling Yang, Peter Chen et al.** · arXiv:2512.19682 · 2025-12-22 · `cs-ai`

Training capable Large Language Model (LLM) agents is critically bottlenecked by the high cost and static nature of real-world interaction data. We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative e...

### [FASTRIC: Prompt Specification Language for Verifiable LLM Interactions](/cs/ai/2512.18940-fastric-prompt-specification-language-for-verifia.md)

### [Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies](/cs/lg/2512.19673-bottom-up-policy-optimization-your-language-model.md)
**Yuqiao Tan, Minzheng Wang, Shizhu He et al.** · arXiv:2512.19673 · 2025-12-22 · `cs-lg`

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reaso...

### [Remedy-R: Generative Reasoning for Machine Translation Evaluation without Error Annotations](/cs/ai/2512.18906-remedy-r-generative-reasoning-for-machine-transla.md)
**Shaomu Tan, Ryosuke Mitani, Ritvik Choudhary et al.** · arXiv:2512.18906 · 2025-12-21 · `cs-ai`

Over the years, automatic MT metrics have hillclimbed benchmarks and presented strong and sometimes human-level agreement with human ratings. Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduc...

### [Delta-LLaVA: Base-then-Specialize Alignment for Token-Efficient Vision-Language Models](/cs/cv/2512.18910-delta-llava-base-then-specialize-alignment-for-to.md)
