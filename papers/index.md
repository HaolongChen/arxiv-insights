### [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](/cs/lg/2512.25063-many-minds-from-one-model-bayesian-transformers-f.md)
**Diji Yang, Yi Zhang** · arXiv:2512.25063 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-lg`

Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we prop...

### [Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future](/cs/lg/2512.25070-scaling-open-ended-reasoning-to-predict-the-future.md)

Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this wit...

### [Evolving, Not Training: Zero-Shot Reasoning Segmentation via Evolutionary Prompting](/cs/cv/2512.24702-evolving-not-training-zero-shot-reasoning-segmen.md)
**Kai Ye, Xiaotong You, Jianghang Lin et al.** · arXiv:2512.24702 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-cv`

### [Vulcan: Instance-Optimal Systems Heuristics Through LLM-Driven Search](/other/2512.25065-vulcan-instance-optimal-systems-heuristics-throug.md)
**Rohit Dwivedula, Divyanshu Saxena, Sujay Yadalam et al.** · arXiv:2512.25065 · 2025-12-31 · `other`

Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously g...

### [Multilingual Hidden Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Based Academic Reviewing](/cs/ai/2512.23684-multilingual-hidden-prompt-injection-attacks-on-ll.md)
