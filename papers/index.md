As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence o...

### [Heterogeneous Low-Bandwidth Pre-Training of LLMs](/cs/lg/2601.02360-heterogeneous-low-bandwidth-pre-training-of-llms.md)
**Yazan Obeidi, Amir Sarfi, Joel Lidin et al.** · arXiv:2601.02360 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-lg`

Pre-training large language models (LLMs) increasingly requires distributed compute, yet bandwidth constraints make it difficult to scale beyond well-provisioned datacenters-especially when model parallelism forces frequent, large inter-device communications. We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-commu...

### [Moments Matter:Stabilizing Policy Optimization using Return Distributions](/cs/lg/2601.01803-moments-matterstabilizing-policy-optimization-usi.md)
**Dennis Jabs, Aditya Mohan, Marius Lindauer** · arXiv:2601.01803 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-lg`

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous...

**Shahnawaz Alam, Mohammed Mudassir Uddin, Mohammed Kaif Pasha** · arXiv:2601.02353 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-cv`

Farmers in remote areas need quick and reliable methods for identifying plant diseases, yet they often lack access to laboratories or high-performance computing resources. Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and compu...

### [Causality-Aware Temporal Projection for Video Understanding in Video-LLMs](/cs/cv/2601.01804-causality-aware-temporal-projection-for-video-unde.md)
**Zhengjian Kang, Qi Chen, Rui Liu et al.** · arXiv:2601.01804 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-cv`

### [ExposeAnyone: Personalized Audio-to-Expression Diffusion Models Are Robust Zero-Shot Face Forgery Detectors](/cs/cv/2601.02359-exposeanyone-personalized-audio-to-expression-dif.md)
**Kaede Shiohara, Toshihiko Yamasaki, Vladislav Golyanik** · arXiv:2601.02359 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-cv`

Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overf...

**Junyi Chen, Tong He, Zhoujie Fu et al.** · arXiv:2601.02358 · 2026-01-05 · `cs-cv`

We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling ...

### [Placement Semantics for Distributed Deep Learning: A Systematic Framework for Analyzing Parallelism Strategies](/other/2601.02311-placement-semantics-for-distributed-deep-learning.md)
**Deep Pankajbhai Mehta** · arXiv:2601.02311 · 2026-01-05 · `other`

Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each st...
