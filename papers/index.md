### [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](/cs/lg/2512.25063-many-minds-from-one-model-bayesian-transformers-f.md)
**Diji Yang, Yi Zhang** · arXiv:2512.25063 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-lg`

Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we prop...

### [Efficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning](/cs/lg/2512.24991-efficiently-estimating-data-efficiency-for-languag.md)
**Gyung Hyun Je, Colin Raffel** · arXiv:2512.24991 · 2025-12-31 · `cs-lg`

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is...
