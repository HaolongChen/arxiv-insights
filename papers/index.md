**Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla et al.** · arXiv:2512.15705 · 2025-12-17 · `other`

Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the...

### [Universal Reasoning Model](/cs/ai/2512.14693-universal-reasoning-model.md)
**Zitian Gao, Lynx Chen, Yihao Xiao et al.** · arXiv:2512.14693 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-ai`

Universal transformers (UTs) have been widely used for complex reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku, yet the specific sources of their performance gains remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the rec...

### [Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing](/cs/ai/2512.14681-fast-and-accurate-causal-parallel-decoding-using-j.md)
**Lanxiang Hu, Siqi Kou, Yichao Fu et al.** · arXiv:2512.14681 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-ai`

Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference.

### [MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](/cs/ai/2512.14691-mmgr-multi-modal-generative-reasoning.md)
**Zefan Cai, Haoyi Qiu, Tianyi Ma et al.** · arXiv:2512.14691 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-ai`

Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook r...

### [ParaFormer: A Generalized PageRank Graph Transformer for Graph Representation Learning](/cs/lg/2512.14619-paraformer-a-generalized-pagerank-graph-transform.md)
**Chaohao Yuan, Zhenjie Song, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu et al.** · arXiv:2512.14619 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-lg`

Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GN...

### [Model-Based Reinforcement Learning in Discrete-Action Non-Markovian Reward Decision Processes](/cs/lg/2512.14617-model-based-reinforcement-learning-in-discrete-act.md)
**Alessandro Trapasso, Luca Iocchi, Fabio Patrizi** · arXiv:2512.14617 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-lg`

Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes ...

### [CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives](/cs/cv/2512.14696-crisp-contact-guided-real2sim-from-monocular-vide.md)
**Zihan Wang, Jiashun Wang, Jeff Tan et al.** · arXiv:2512.14696 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-cv`

We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tra...

### [WorldPlay: Towards Long-Term Geometric Consistency for Real-Time Interactive World Modeling](/cs/cv/2512.14614-worldplay-towards-long-term-geometric-consistency.md)
**Wenqiang Sun, Haiyu Zhang, Haoyuan Wang et al.** · arXiv:2512.14614 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-cv`

This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual A...

**Rao Muhammad Umer, Daniel Sens, Jonathan Noll et al.** · arXiv:2512.14640 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-cv`

Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring cos...

### [TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](/cs/cv/2512.14698-timelens-rethinking-video-temporal-grounding-with.md)
**Jun Zhang, Teng Wang, Yuying Ge et al.** · arXiv:2512.14698 · 2025-12-16 · `cs-cv`

This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the rec...

### [AMD-HookNet++: Evolution of AMD-HookNet with Hybrid CNN-Transformer Feature Enhancement for Glacier Calving Front Segmentation](/cs/cv/2512.14639-amd-hooknet-evolution-of-amd-hooknet-with-hybri.md)
