### [Directional Textual Inversion for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation](/cs/lg/2512.13672-directional-textual-inversion-for-personalized-tex.md)
**Kunhee Kim, NaHyeon Park, Kibeom Hong et al.** · arXiv:2512.13672 · 2025-12-15 · `cs-lg`

Textual Inversion (TI) is an efficient approach to text-to-image personalization but often fails on complex prompts. We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we sh...

### [A Scientific Reasoning Model for Organic Synthesis Procedure Generation](/cs/lg/2512.13668-a-scientific-reasoning-model-for-organic-synthesis.md)

Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users t...

### [Grab-3D: Detecting AI-Generated Videos from 3D Geometric Temporal Consistency](/cs/cv/2512.13665-grab-3d-detecting-ai-generated-videos-from-3d-geo.md)

Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or caus...

### [AgentIAD: Tool-Augmented Single-Agent for Industrial Anomaly Detection](/cs/cv/2512.13671-agentiad-tool-augmented-single-agent-for-industri.md)
**Junwen Miao, Penghui Du, Yi Liu et al.** · arXiv:2512.13671 · 2025-12-15 · `cs-cv`

Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We...

### [LitePT: Lighter Yet Stronger Point Transformer](/cs/cv/2512.13689-litept-lighter-yet-stronger-point-transformer.md)
**Yuanwen Yue, Damien Robert, Jianyuan Wang et al.** · arXiv:2512.13689 · 2025-12-15 · `cs-cv`

Modern neural architectures for 3D point cloud processing contain both convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the best way to assemble them remains unclear. We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequa...

### [JoVA: Unified Multimodal Learning for Joint Video-Audio Generation](/cs/cv/2512.13677-jova-unified-multimodal-learning-for-joint-video.md)
**Xiaohu Huang, Hao Zhou, Qiangpeng Yang et al.** · arXiv:2512.13677 · 2025-12-15 · `cs-cv`

**Daniel Zoran, Nikhil Parthasarathy, Yi Yang et al.** · arXiv:2512.13684 · 2025-12-15 · `cs-cv`

We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymme...

### [State over Tokens: Characterizing the Role of Reasoning Tokens](/cs/ai/2512.12777-state-over-tokens-characterizing-the-role-of-reas.md)
**Mosh Levy, Zohar Elyoseph, Shauli Ravfogel et al.** · arXiv:2512.12777 · 2025-12-14 · `cs-ai`

Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address...

### [Persistent Personas? Role-Playing, Instruction Following, and Safety in Extended Interactions](/cs/ai/2512.12775-persistent-personas-role-playing-instruction-fol.md)
**Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Michael A. Hedderich, Ali Modarressi et al.** · arXiv:2512.12775 · 2025-12-14 · `cs-ai`

Persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) are used in domains such as education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulation. Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long person...

### [FysicsWorld: A Unified Full-Modality Benchmark for Any-to-Any Understanding, Generation, and Reasoning](/cs/cv/2512.12756-fysicsworld-a-unified-full-modality-benchmark-for.md)

Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and emerging omni-modal architectures, current benchmarks remain limited in scope and integration, suffering from incomplete modality coverage, restricted interaction to text-centric outputs, and weak interdependence and complementar...

### [JointAVBench: A Benchmark for Joint Audio-Visual Reasoning Evaluation](/other/2512.12772-jointavbench-a-benchmark-for-joint-audio-visual-r.md)
**Jianghan Chao, Jianzhang Gao, Wenhui Tan et al.** · arXiv:2512.12772 · 2025-12-14 · `other`

Understanding videos inherently requires reasoning over both visual and auditory information. To properly evaluate Omni-Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs), which are capable of processing multi-modal information including vision and audio, an effective benchmark must comprehensively cover three key a...

### [Adaptive Edge-Cloud Inference for Speech-to-Action Systems Using ASR and Large Language Models (ASTA)](/other/2512.12769-adaptive-edge-cloud-inference-for-speech-to-action.md)
**Mohammad Jalili Torkamani, Israt Zarin** · arXiv:2512.12769 · 2025-12-14 · `other`

Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependenc...

### [HAROOD: A Benchmark for Out-of-distribution Generalization in Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition](/cs/ai/2512.10807-harood-a-benchmark-for-out-of-distribution-genera.md)
**Wang Lu, Yao Zhu, Jindong Wang** · arXiv:2512.10807 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-ai`

Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this ch...

### [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](/cs/ai/2512.10895-llms-can-assist-with-proposal-selection-at-large-u.md)
**Lijie Ding, Janell Thomson, Jon Taylor et al.** · arXiv:2512.10895 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-ai`

We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; howev...

**Muhammad Umair Haider, Hammad Rizwan, Hassan Sajjad et al.** · arXiv:2512.10903 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-ai`

Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP bloc...

### [Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity](/cs/ai/2512.10882-computational-emotion-analysis-with-multimodal-llm.md)
**Hauke Licht** · arXiv:2512.10882 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-ai`

Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about ...

### [SparseSwaps: Tractable LLM Pruning Mask Refinement at Scale](/cs/lg/2512.10922-sparseswaps-tractable-llm-pruning-mask-refinement.md)
**Max Zimmer, Christophe Roux, Moritz Wagner et al.** · arXiv:2512.10922 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classic...
