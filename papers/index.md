### [Diffusion Knows Transparency: Repurposing Video Diffusion for Transparent Object Depth and Normal Estimation](/cs/cv/2512.23705-diffusion-knows-transparency-repurposing-video-di.md)
**Shaocong Xu, Songlin Wei, Qizhe Wei et al.** · arXiv:2512.23705 · 2025-12-29 · `cs-cv`

Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models a...

### [CME-CAD: Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning for CAD Code Generation](/cs/cv/2512.23333-cme-cad-heterogeneous-collaborative-multi-expert.md)

The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective an...

### [OmniAgent: Audio-Guided Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding](/cs/cv/2512.23646-omniagent-audio-guided-active-perception-agent-fo.md)
