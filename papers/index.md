However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-e...

### [Exploration v.s. Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward](/cs/lg/2512.16912-exploration-vs-exploitation-rethinking-rlvr-thr.md)

### [Semi-Supervised Online Learning on the Edge by Transforming Knowledge from Teacher Models](/cs/lg/2512.16866-semi-supervised-online-learning-on-the-edge-by-tra.md)
**Jiabin Xue** · arXiv:2512.16866 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-lg`

Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to b...

### [Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](/cs/lg/2512.16911-posterior-behavioral-cloning-pretraining-bc-polic.md)
**Andrew Wagenmaker, Perry Dong, Raymond Tsao et al.** · arXiv:2512.16911 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-lg`

Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical ...

### [FlashPortrait: 6x Faster Infinite Portrait Animation with Adaptive Latent Prediction](/cs/cv/2512.16900-flashportrait-6x-faster-infinite-portrait-animati.md)
