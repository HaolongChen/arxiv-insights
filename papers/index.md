**Yuan Qiu, Wolfgang Dahmen, Peng Chen** · arXiv:2512.21319 · 2025-12-24 · `other`

Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty term...

### [Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors](/other/2512.21335-autonomous-uncertainty-quantification-for-computat.md)
