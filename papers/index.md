### [Relu and softplus neural nets as zero-sum turn-based games](/cs/lg/2512.20582-relu-and-softplus-neural-nets-as-zero-sum-turn-bas.md)
**Stephane Gaubert, Yiannis Vlassopoulos** · arXiv:2512.20582 · 2025-12-23 · `cs-lg`

We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact,...

### [Performative Policy Gradient: Optimality in Performative Reinforcement Learning](/cs/lg/2512.20576-performative-policy-gradient-optimality-in-perfor.md)
