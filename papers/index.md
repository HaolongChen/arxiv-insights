### [SparseSwaps: Tractable LLM Pruning Mask Refinement at Scale](/cs/lg/2512.10922-sparseswaps-tractable-llm-pruning-mask-refinement.md)
**Max Zimmer, Christophe Roux, Moritz Wagner et al.** · arXiv:2512.10922 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classic...

Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations ar...

### [Extrapolation of Periodic Functions Using Binary Encoding of Continuous Numerical Values](/cs/lg/2512.10817-extrapolation-of-periodic-functions-using-binary-e.md)

### [Scaling Behavior of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](/cs/lg/2512.10858-scaling-behavior-of-discrete-diffusion-language-mo.md)
**Dimitri von Rütte, Janis Fluri, Omead Pooladzandi et al.** · arXiv:2512.10858 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However,...

### [Stronger Normalization-Free Transformers](/cs/lg/2512.10938-stronger-normalization-free-transformers.md)
**Mingzhi Chen, Taiming Lu, Jiachen Zhu et al.** · arXiv:2512.10938 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches norm...

### [Digital Twin Supervised Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Underwater Navigation](/cs/lg/2512.10925-digital-twin-supervised-reinforcement-learning-fra.md)

### [Are We Ready for RL in Text-to-3D Generation? A Progressive Investigation](/cs/cv/2512.10949-are-we-ready-for-rl-in-text-to-3d-generation-a-pr.md)
**Yiwen Tang, Zoey Guo, Kaixin Zhu et al.** · arXiv:2512.10949 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which req...

### [AlcheMinT: Fine-grained Temporal Control for Multi-Reference Consistent Video Generation](/cs/cv/2512.10943-alchemint-fine-grained-temporal-control-for-multi.md)
**Sharath Girish, Viacheslav Ivanov, Tsai-Shien Chen et al.** · arXiv:2512.10943 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applicatio...

### [Towards Efficient and Effective Multi-Camera Encoding for End-to-End Driving](/cs/cv/2512.10947-towards-efficient-and-effective-multi-camera-encod.md)
**Jiawei Yang, Ziyu Chen, Yurong You et al.** · arXiv:2512.10947 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving.

### [Group Diffusion: Enhancing Image Generation by Unlocking Cross-Sample Collaboration](/cs/cv/2512.10954-group-diffusion-enhancing-image-generation-by-unl.md)
**Sicheng Mo, Thao Nguyen, Richard Zhang et al.** · arXiv:2512.10954 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rathe...

### [SWiT-4D: Sliding-Window Transformer for Lossless and Parameter-Free Temporal 4D Generation](/cs/cv/2512.10860-swit-4d-sliding-window-transformer-for-lossless-a.md)
**Kehong Gong, Zhengyu Wen, Mingxi Xu et al.** · arXiv:2512.10860 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable ...

### [Any4D: Unified Feed-Forward Metric 4D Reconstruction](/cs/cv/2512.10935-any4d-unified-feed-forward-metric-4d-reconstructi.md)
**Jay Karhade, Nikhil Keetha, Yuchen Zhang et al.** · arXiv:2512.10935 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking....

### [GaussianHeadTalk: Wobble-Free 3D Talking Heads with Audio Driven Gaussian Splatting](/cs/cv/2512.10939-gaussianheadtalk-wobble-free-3d-talking-heads-wit.md)
**Madhav Agarwal, Mingtian Zhang, Laura Sevilla-Lara et al.** · arXiv:2512.10939 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot se...

### [FoundationMotion: Auto-Labeling and Reasoning about Spatial Movement in Videos](/cs/cv/2512.10927-foundationmotion-auto-labeling-and-reasoning-abou.md)
**Yulu Gan, Ligeng Zhu, Dandan Shan et al.** · arXiv:2512.10927 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets ar...

### [OmniView: An All-Seeing Diffusion Model for 3D and 4D View Synthesis](/cs/cv/2512.10940-omniview-an-all-seeing-diffusion-model-for-3d-and.md)
**Xiang Fan, Sharath Girish, Vivek Ramanujan et al.** · arXiv:2512.10940 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D ...
