### [SparseSwaps: Tractable LLM Pruning Mask Refinement at Scale](/cs/lg/2512.10922-sparseswaps-tractable-llm-pruning-mask-refinement.md)
**Max Zimmer, Christophe Roux, Moritz Wagner et al.** · arXiv:2512.10922 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classic...

Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However,...

### [Stronger Normalization-Free Transformers](/cs/lg/2512.10938-stronger-normalization-free-transformers.md)
**Mingzhi Chen, Taiming Lu, Jiachen Zhu et al.** · arXiv:2512.10938 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-lg`

Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches norm...

### [Digital Twin Supervised Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Underwater Navigation](/cs/lg/2512.10925-digital-twin-supervised-reinforcement-learning-fra.md)

### [Are We Ready for RL in Text-to-3D Generation? A Progressive Investigation](/cs/cv/2512.10949-are-we-ready-for-rl-in-text-to-3d-generation-a-pr.md)
**Yiwen Tang, Zoey Guo, Kaixin Zhu et al.** · arXiv:2512.10949 · 2025-12-11 · `cs-cv`

Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which req...
