**Jiacheng Guo, Ling Yang, Peter Chen et al.** · arXiv:2512.19682 · 2025-12-22 · `cs-ai`

Training capable Large Language Model (LLM) agents is critically bottlenecked by the high cost and static nature of real-world interaction data. We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative e...

### [FASTRIC: Prompt Specification Language for Verifiable LLM Interactions](/cs/ai/2512.18940-fastric-prompt-specification-language-for-verifia.md)

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance on semantic tasks, their spatial intelligence--crucial for robust and grounded AI systems--remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified ...

### [Efficient Vision Mamba for MRI Super-Resolution via Hybrid Selective Scanning](/cs/cv/2512.19676-efficient-vision-mamba-for-mri-super-resolution-vi.md)
**Mojtaba Safari, Shansong Wang, Vanessa L Wildman et al.** · arXiv:2512.19676 · 2025-12-22 · `cs-cv`

### [Remedy-R: Generative Reasoning for Machine Translation Evaluation without Error Annotations](/cs/ai/2512.18906-remedy-r-generative-reasoning-for-machine-transla.md)
**Shaomu Tan, Ryosuke Mitani, Ritvik Choudhary et al.** · arXiv:2512.18906 · 2025-12-21 · `cs-ai`

Over the years, automatic MT metrics have hillclimbed benchmarks and presented strong and sometimes human-level agreement with human ratings. Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduc...

### [Delta-LLaVA: Base-then-Specialize Alignment for Token-Efficient Vision-Language Models](/cs/cv/2512.18910-delta-llava-base-then-specialize-alignment-for-to.md)

### [An Empirical Study of Developer-Provided Context for AI Coding Assistants in Open-Source Projects](/other/2512.18925-an-empirical-study-of-developer-provided-context-f.md)
**Shaokang Jiang, Daye Nam** · arXiv:2512.18925 · 2025-12-21 · `other`

**Eric Todd, Jannik Brinkmann, Rohit Gandikota et al.** · arXiv:2512.16902 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, t...

### [Exploration of Augmentation Strategies in Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for the Biomedical Domain: A Case Study Evaluating Question Answering in Glycobiology](/cs/ai/2512.16802-exploration-of-augmentation-strategies-in-multi-mo.md)

Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study ...

### [LLMCache: Layer-Wise Caching Strategies for Accelerated Reuse in Transformer Inference](/cs/ai/2512.16843-llmcache-layer-wise-caching-strategies-for-accele.md)
**Harsh Vardhan Bansal** · arXiv:2512.16843 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autor...

### [TOGGLE: Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression for Edge](/cs/ai/2512.16855-toggle-temporal-logic-guided-large-language-model.md)

Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguis...

### [Multimodal RewardBench 2: Evaluating Omni Reward Models for Interleaved Text and Image](/cs/ai/2512.16899-multimodal-rewardbench-2-evaluating-omni-reward-m.md)
**Yushi Hu, Reyhane Askari-Hemmat, Melissa Hall et al.** · arXiv:2512.16899 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (...

### [Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](/cs/ai/2512.16917-generative-adversarial-reasoner-enhancing-llm-rea.md)
**Qihao Liu, Luoxin Ye, Wufei Ma et al.** · arXiv:2512.16917 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy j...

**Shubham Mishra, Samyek Jain, Gorang Mehrishi et al.** · arXiv:2512.16795 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-...

### [AdaSearch: Balancing Parametric Knowledge and Search in Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](/cs/ai/2512.16883-adasearch-balancing-parametric-knowledge-and-sear.md)
**Tzu-Han Lin, Wei-Lin Chen, Chen-An Li et al.** · arXiv:2512.16883 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-ai`

Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric...

### [Meta-RL Induces Exploration in Language Agents](/cs/lg/2512.16848-meta-rl-induces-exploration-in-language-agents.md)
**Yulun Jiang, Liangze Jiang, Damien Teney et al.** · arXiv:2512.16848 · 2025-12-18 · `cs-lg`

Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks.
