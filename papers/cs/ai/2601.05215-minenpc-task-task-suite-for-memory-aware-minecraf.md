## Abstract

We present \textsc{MineNPC-Task}, a user-authored benchmark and evaluation harness for testing memory-aware, mixed-initiative LLM agents in open-world \emph{Minecraft}. Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.   As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \textbf{216} subtasks across \textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.
