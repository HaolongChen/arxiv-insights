## Abstract

Recent advances in diffusion-based generation techniques enable AI models to produce highly realistic videos, heightening the need for reliable detection mechanisms. However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators.
